Scenario-Based Customer Responses

Scenario 1: Markets Too High - Customer Wants to Wait
Customer Concern: "Markets are too high, I wish to pay when markets fall"
Response Points:
- Specific due dates must be met, or Rs. 10,00,000 life insurance becomes NIL
- Option to invest in debt-oriented funds with lower risk like Bond Fund (5.45% returns)
- Can switch to equity funds anytime when market views change
- Auto-transfer Portfolio strategy available for systematic debt-to-equity movement

Scenario 2: Single Premium Plan Confusion
Customer Concern: "I don't want to pay more premiums, was sold as single premium"
Response Points:
- Premium Payment Term (PPT) is clearly 7 years as per policy document
- Discontinuing causes two-fold value loss:
  * Money goes to low-yield Discontinued Life Fund (4.30% returns vs 16.91% in Pure Stock Fund)
  * Loss of Rs. 10,00,000 life cover
- Continuing gives loyalty additions of Rs. 22,000 over policy term
- Can continue with market-linked funds for better returns

Scenario 3: Financial Emergency
Customer Concern: "Emergency financial needs, cannot pay premiums"
Response Points:
- Due date deadline critical - life insurance of Rs. 10,00,000 becomes NIL if not paid
- Suggest credit card payment option for immediate relief
- After revival, can switch to half-yearly, quarterly, or monthly frequency
- If policy completed 5 years: partial withdrawal option available for emergencies
- Must pay full outstanding amount first, then new frequency applies from next premium

Scenario 4: Better Investment Alternatives
Customer Concern: "Mutual funds or business investments are better"
Response Points:
- Compare effective charges: Most mutual funds have 2% expense ratios WITHOUT life cover
- Your policy's effective charges reduce to only 1.61% for remaining term (vs current 3.89%)
- Loyalty additions of Rs. 22,000 not available in mutual funds
- Life insurance cover of Rs. 10,00,000 included (separate cost in other investments)
- Returns get closer to actual fund performance as charges reduce

Scenario 5: Unsatisfactory Returns
Customer Concern: "Low returns, not satisfied with policy performance"
Response Points:
- Current annualised effective returns: 11.47% (post all charges and taxes)
- Effective charges drop sharply after lock-in: from 3.89% to only 1.61%
- Can switch funds anytime based on risk appetite
- Historical fund performance shows strong returns (Pure Stock Fund: 16.91%)
- Bond Fund available for conservative approach (5.45% returns)

Scenario 6: Buying New Policy
Customer Concern: "Want to buy a new policy instead"
Response Points:
- New ULIP: Higher initial charges vs existing policy's low 1.61% remaining charges
- Your current policy much cheaper than new ULIP for remaining term
- Traditional savings plan: Consider diversifying by switching to debt funds in current policy
- Asset allocation can be managed within existing policy without new charges
- Surrendering existing policy loses accumulated benefits and loyalty additions
