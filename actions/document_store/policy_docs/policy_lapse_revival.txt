Policy Status and Revival - Critical Information

Current Policy Status:
Your policy is currently due for Rs. 1,00,000 premium payment by 25th September 2024. Fund value of Rs. 5,53,089 and Rs. 10,00,000 life cover at risk if payment not made.

Consequences of Policy Lapse:
If premium not paid:
- Rs. 10,00,000 life insurance cover becomes NIL immediately
- Your Rs. 5,53,089 fund value moves to Discontinued Life Fund
- Discontinued Life Fund gives only 4.30% returns vs your current 11.47% effective returns
- Loss of Rs. 22,000 loyalty benefits

Financial Impact of Discontinuation:
Your money shifts from high-performing funds (16.91% Pure Stock returns) to low-yield Discontinued Life Fund (4.30%). This severely impacts your wealth creation potential.

Better Alternatives than Lapse:
1. Pay via credit card for immediate relief
2. Switch to Bond Fund (5.45% returns) if risk-averse
3. Use partial withdrawal facility (after 5 years) for emergencies
4. Change to monthly/quarterly frequency after paying current dues

Immediate Action Required:
Pay Rs. 1,00,000 by 25th September 2024 to:
- Maintain Rs. 10,00,000 life cover
- Continue earning 11.47% effective returns
- Preserve Rs. 22,000 loyalty benefits
- Keep wealth building momentum with remaining 3 premium years

Premium Payment Term Advantage:
Only 3 more years of premium payments required (out of 7-year PPT), but policy continues for full 10 years with life cover and fund growth.
